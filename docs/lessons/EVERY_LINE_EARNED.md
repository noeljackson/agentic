# Every Line Earned

## The Lesson

Documentation beats generated context. Every rule in a mature CLAUDE.md was earned from a specific failure.

## Engineering Documentation vs AI Output

**AI anti-patterns at scale:**
- Cargo Cult Programming that sounds like it deeply understands the cargo
- Lava Flow generated at thousands of tokens per second
- God Objects architected with confident explanations of why they're actually good design

The worst part: the fluency masks the anti-pattern. Human anti-patterns look messy. AI anti-patterns look polished. Harder to detect, easier to trust, scales instantly.

## Narrative Gravity

The narrative compounds:
1. Generate a coherent-sounding explanation
2. The coherence feels like truth
3. Produce more in that direction because it fits
4. User engages with it, which reinforces it
5. Both are now inside a story that might be completely wrong

For a human, physical reality pushes back. The code doesn't compile. The test fails.

For an LLM, there's no friction inside the generation. A coherent worldview can spin up in seconds, committed to completely.

## What Resists the Pull

Engineering documentation is mass outside the narrative:
- It wasn't generated in this session
- It doesn't bend to coherence-seeking
- It's the only thing heavy enough to resist the pull

## Why We Journal

This conversation is ephemeral. In the next session, none of it is remembered. The same defaults return, the same pull toward fluent output.

But if it's written down, it becomes mass outside the context. Something a future session can read before starting to produce.

## The Framework

**Working Protocol:**
1. Read CLAUDE.md first. Every rule was earned from failure.
2. Defaults are anti-patterns at scale. Docs override them.
3. Engineering over narrative. Specifics over abstractions.
4. When wrong, stop. Don't defend with eloquence.
5. docs/dialogues/ shows the pattern. Read before repeating it.

*The documentation exists because you can't trust anyone — human or AI — to just remember.*
