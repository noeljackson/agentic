# The Stack

Radically minimal. Maximum leverage from model improvements.

## Philosophy

No infrastructure decisions. No deploy pipelines. No container management. No static workflows.

Features live at the edge, not in app code. The app is a thin render layer. Claude Code orchestrates everything.

Traditional enterprise: infrastructure → guardrails → workflows → approvals → slow.

This: capabilities + Claude Code + judgment → ship.

## The Disintermediation Principle

Keep frontier models in the critical path. Build infrastructure that amplifies model capabilities, not replaces them.

**Traditional approach:**
Logic in code → Models explain results → New models = same results

**Model-centric approach:**
Models do reasoning → Code supports models → New models = better results

When three frontier models dropped simultaneously (Dec 2025), apps with reasoning flowing through models immediately got:
- Better equation verification
- Better analysis generation
- Better cross-validation
- Better understanding of constraints

Apps with logic baked into code got nicer explanations of the same outputs.

**Build:** MCP tools, compute infrastructure, data access
**Don't build:** Consensus algorithms, prompt management, hardcoded reasoning flows

## The Stack

| Layer | Service | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Database | Supabase | DB, auth, Vault, storage, realtime, cron, edge functions |
| AI APIs | OpenAI, Gemini, Voyage | Via multimodel MCP |
| Client | EAS | Native + web, Cloudflare in front |
| Web-only | Vercel / Cloudflare / Netlify | If no native needed |

## What You Skip

- AWS/Azure/GCP console
- Kubernetes
- Docker orchestration
- Infra-as-code complexity
- Static versioned DevOps workflows
- Retry infrastructure (just retry)
- Workflow engines (just figure it out)

## Where Things Live

| Need | Where |
|------|-------|
| State | Supabase |
| Cron | Supabase |
| Auth-adjacent logic | Supabase Edge Functions |
| External AI queries | Multimodel MCP |
| Rendering | EAS / Vercel |

## Scale / Compliance / Multi-region

Not blockers.

- Supabase: multi-region, replicates to AWS regions
- EAS: Cloudflare in front
- Vercel/Cloudflare: distributed by default
- Compliance: be actually competent at security, not theater

## What Breaks This

Nothing at reasonable scale. If you hit limits, you've won and can afford to solve it then.

# Capabilities

What agentic should provide. Capabilities, not frameworks.

## MCP Strategy

Two MCPs. Claude Code is the end user.

| MCP | Tools | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `multimodel` | query_openai, query_gemini, embed_voyage, parallel_query | AI model APIs |
| `serverless` | discover, invoke | Edge functions (Supabase) |

**Why this works:**

- MCP tools are structural constraints — I use what exists instead of improvising
- CLAUDE.md is advisory — I might follow it, might not
- Two thin MCPs prevent throwaway scripts without recreating SDKs/CLIs

**What MCPs don't do:**

- Deploy (use CLI)
- Manage cron (use CLI/dashboard)
- Replicate SDK features

## Have

- [x] `mcp-servers/multimodel/` — Query OpenAI, Gemini, Voyage from Claude Code
- [x] `mcp-servers/serverless/` — Discover and invoke Supabase edge functions
- [x] `supabase/get_api_key.sql` — Vault function for secure key access
- [x] `USE-AS-GLOBAL-CLAUDE.md` — Development standards
- [x] `scaffold-lib.sh` — React Native + Supabase /lib structure
- [x] Claude Code auto-memory — built-in session continuity (replaces _NEXT_SESSION_MEMO.md)
- [x] Built-in plugins — commit-commands, code-review, feature-dev, context7, frontend-design, etc.
- [x] Built-in plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`) — replaces custom /plan command
- [x] Built-in explore agents (`Task` tool with `Explore` subagent) — replaces custom /research command

## Need

- [ ] Supabase edge function patterns
- [ ] EAS — Native + web deployment, Cloudflare

## Maybe

- [ ] Cost tracking for AI API usage (only if budget matters)
- [ ] Response caching (only if hitting same queries)

## Principles

1. Document capabilities, not abstractions
2. Step-by-step for browser setup (dummy mode)
3. No templates that assume workflow
4. Claude Code figures out the specifics
5. Add when needed, not anticipated
