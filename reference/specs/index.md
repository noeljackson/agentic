Protocol definitions — the authoritative source for how coordination works.

## Coordination Protocols

| Spec | What It Defines |
|------|-----------------|
| [coordination.md](coordination.md) | _AGENTS.md structure, handoff formats, decision queues |
| [decisions.md](decisions.md) | Agent vs human decision rights, escalation patterns |
| [feature-spec.md](feature-spec.md) | Feature specification format, task dependencies |

## When to Read These

These are reference specs, not tutorials. Read them when:

- You need the exact format for a handoff
- You're debugging a coordination issue
- You want to understand the protocol deeply

For getting started, see [guides/getting-started.md](../guides/getting-started.md).
